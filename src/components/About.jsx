        I fell in love with programming and at least learned something I think... 🤷‍♂
        <br/>
        I am fluent in classics such as C, C++, Java, PHP, Javascript, TypeScript and Python.
      <br/>
        My field of interest is the development of new technologies and web products and also in areas related to Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.
      <br/>
          I also cultivated a passion for robotic prototypes and IOT using Raspberry Pi and Arduini.      
      <br/>
        Whenever possible, I also apply my passion for developing products with SQL, Node.js and Modern Javascript Library and Frameworks like React.js and Next.js
      <br/>
        I have participated in development teams using the agile-scrum methodology, and I have had the opportunity to experience IT at a company level.
      <br/>
        I am always looking for new adventurers who can contribute to my personal and professional development.
